# Advent of Code 2025

This repo captures my efforts to solve the daily puzzles in the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

I'm solving the puzzles by writing code in Rust on a Linux system (Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS) using a terminal window and the Helix editor. I'm using these puzzles to help drive my attempt to learn the Rust language and achieve some reasonable level of proficiency.
